For the food choices file, the zip file contains an Excel sheet with all the data, as well as a Word document that gives some supplementary information about notations. For example, survey participants put a \"1\" in the Gender column if they were female, and a \"2\" if they were male. For those columns, I will eventually convert the numbers to data that is easily understandable without an extra document. <br>\n",

My conclusions might sound something like: \"Ice cream appears in x%  of entries under \"nausea\" but 0 times under \"death\".
